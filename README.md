# Useful Powershell Scripts

## Useful powershell scripts for working with Microsoft servers via PowerShell.

## This repo contains random cmdlets and scripts that I've used on various projects.

### `Get-Help Get`
#### This cmdlet will return a very long list of all the Get- cmdlets
#### Just like `Get-Help Test` will return a list of all Test- cmdlets
#### Use `Get-History` to pull a list of your PS session (will show as an id)
#### `Invoke-History -id 24` as an example so you don't have to retype it

### Useful one line scripts & cmdlets
------------------

`Get-WindowsUpdateLog` to get the log of installed updates
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force` for unrestricted Powershell profile
